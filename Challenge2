// Challenge 2
// Rick Senn
/* 
Write a new version of the Guess My Number program that does the following: 
  1. the player and the computer can switch roles. That is, the player picks a number and the computer must guess what it is. 
    (These guesses should display back to the player e.g. "The computer guessed 10. That's too high! The computer guessed 2. That's too low!" etc.)

  2. the player can choose if the player is the picker or the guesser at the start of the game

  3. the player can choose the difficulty. Easy Mode has unlimited guesses. Medium Mode has a limit of 10 guesses. Hard Mode has a limit of 3 guesses.

Review your Ch 2 Exercise and/or the book demo starting on page 69. It may help to have completed the Ch 2 Exercise assignment first.
